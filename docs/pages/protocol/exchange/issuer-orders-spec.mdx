# Issuer Orders

## Abstract

This specification extends the stablecoin DEX with **issuer orders**, a special order type that allows token issuers to provide liquidity without locking capital. An issuer order can be placed by the issuer of the base token, the quote token, or both. When an issuer provides their token on an order, it is minted on-demand when filled rather than escrowed upfront. When an issuer receives their token on an order, it is immediately burned rather than credited to their balance. Issuer orders integrate with the existing flip order mechanism, enabling perpetual mint/burn market-making strategies.

## Motivation

Stablecoin issuers often want to provide liquidity for their token without tying up large amounts of capital in resting orders. Traditional orders require the maker to escrow tokens upfront, forcing issuers to pre-mint tokens they may never sell and creating operational complexity in managing reserves across multiple price levels.

Issuer orders solve this by allowing the issuer to commit to mint tokens at specific prices. The tokens only come into existence when someone trades against the order. The symmetric burn-on-receive behavior enables issuers to run perpetual two-sided markets that mint on one side and burn on the other, maintaining price stability without accumulating inventory.

When the maker is the issuer of both the base and quote tokens, they can run a completely capital-free market, minting one token and burning the other on every fill.

## Specification

### Issuer order behavior

An issuer order carries two boolean flags: `isBaseIssuer` and `isQuoteIssuer`. Each flag independently controls the mint/burn behavior for that token based on the order side.

When `isBaseIssuer` is true on an ask order (selling base), no base token escrow is required at placement. When the order is filled, the DEX mints base tokens directly to the taker's internal balance rather than transferring from escrow. When `isBaseIssuer` is true on a bid order (buying base), the base tokens that would normally be credited to the maker are instead burned.

When `isQuoteIssuer` is true on a bid order (paying with quote), no quote token escrow is required at placement. When the order is filled, the DEX mints quote tokens to pay the taker. When `isQuoteIssuer` is true on an ask order (receiving quote), the quote tokens that would normally be credited to the maker are instead burned.

Both flags can be true simultaneously. When both are set, an ask order mints base tokens for the taker and burns the quote tokens received, while a bid order burns the base tokens received and mints quote tokens for the taker. This enables zero-capital market making where the issuer never holds inventory of either token.

If minting would exceed a token's supply cap, the order partially fills up to the remaining mintable amount.

### Escrow behavior

The escrow requirement depends on the combination of flags and order side. For ask orders, base tokens are escrowed unless `isBaseIssuer` is true. For bid orders, quote tokens are escrowed unless `isQuoteIssuer` is true. When both conditions align (base issuer ask or quote issuer bid), no escrow is required at all.

Cancellation refunds any escrowed tokens. For orders with no escrow, cancellation simply removes the order from the book.

### Authorization

The DEX verifies that the maker has the appropriate `ISSUER_ROLE` at placement time. If `isBaseIssuer` is true, the maker must have `ISSUER_ROLE` on the base token. If `isQuoteIssuer` is true, the maker must have `ISSUER_ROLE` on the quote token. If both flags are true, both roles are required.

No role check is performed at fill time. Once placed, an issuer order will mint or burn as specified regardless of subsequent role changes. This ensures deterministic swap execution and accurate quote estimation.

To handle issuer role transitions, anyone may cancel an issuer order whose maker no longer holds the required `ISSUER_ROLE`(s). The `cancelStaleIssuerOrder` function checks the maker's current role status for each applicable token and, if any required role has been revoked, cancels the order and refunds any escrowed tokens.

### Order representation

The `Order` struct gains two new boolean fields:

```solidity
struct Order {
    uint128 orderId;
    address maker;
    bytes32 bookKey;
    bool isBid;
    int16 tick;
    uint128 amount;
    uint128 remaining;
    uint128 prev;
    uint128 next;
    bool isFlip;
    int16 flipTick;
    bool isBaseIssuer;
    bool isQuoteIssuer;
}
```

### Flip order integration

Issuer orders fully support the flip mechanism. When an issuer flip order is fully filled, the newly created order on the opposite side preserves both `isBaseIssuer` and `isQuoteIssuer` flags. This enables perpetual mint/burn cycles where the issuer order behavior is consistent across all flips.

### Quoting

Issuer orders appear as regular liquidity in the orderbook. The `quoteSwapExactAmountIn` and `quoteSwapExactAmountOut` functions do not distinguish between regular and issuer orders; they sum available liquidity at each tick regardless of order type.

### Interface

#### Issuer order placement

```solidity
function placeIssuer(address token, uint128 amount, bool isBid, int16 tick, bool isBaseIssuer, bool isQuoteIssuer) external returns (uint128 orderId);
```

Places an issuer limit order against the pair of `token` and its quote. At least one of `isBaseIssuer` or `isQuoteIssuer` must be true. The caller must have `ISSUER_ROLE` on the base token if `isBaseIssuer` is true, and on the quote token if `isQuoteIssuer` is true. Escrow is taken only for tokens where the caller is not acting as issuer.

```solidity
function placeIssuerFlip(address token, uint128 amount, bool isBid, int16 tick, int16 flipTick, bool isBaseIssuer, bool isQuoteIssuer) external returns (uint128 orderId);
```

Like `placeIssuer`, but marks the order as a flip order. When fully filled, a new issuer order is placed on the opposite side at `flipTick` with the same issuer flags. The flip tick constraints match regular flip orders.

#### Stale order cancellation

```solidity
function cancelStaleIssuerOrder(uint128 orderId) external;
```

Cancels an issuer order whose maker no longer has the required `ISSUER_ROLE`(s). Can be called by anyone. Reverts if the order has no issuer flags set or if the maker still holds all required roles.

### Events

The existing `OrderPlaced` and `FlipOrderPlaced` events gain `isBaseIssuer` and `isQuoteIssuer` fields:

```solidity
event OrderPlaced(uint128 indexed orderId, address indexed maker, address indexed token, uint128 amount, bool isBid, int16 tick, bool isBaseIssuer, bool isQuoteIssuer);
event FlipOrderPlaced(uint128 indexed orderId, address indexed maker, address indexed token, uint128 amount, bool isBid, int16 tick, int16 flipTick, bool isBaseIssuer, bool isQuoteIssuer);
```

The `OrderFilled` and `OrderCancelled` events remain unchanged.

### Errors

```solidity
error NotTokenIssuer();
error IssuerOrderNotStale();
error NotIssuerOrder();
```

`NotTokenIssuer` is returned when attempting to place an issuer order without the required `ISSUER_ROLE`(s). `IssuerOrderNotStale` is returned when attempting to cancel an issuer order whose maker still has all required roles. `NotIssuerOrder` is returned when calling `cancelStaleIssuerOrder` on an order with neither issuer flag set.

### Implementation notes

When filling an order with `isBaseIssuer` true, the DEX either mints base tokens (for asks) or burns received base tokens (for bids), invoking the token's mint or burn function with the order maker as the authorized caller. The same logic applies symmetrically for `isQuoteIssuer` and quote tokens.

Minted tokens are subject to the token's transfer policy and supply cap. If the recipient is blocked by the transfer policy, the fill fails. If minting would exceed the supply cap, the order partially fills up to the remaining mintable amount.

## Example

An issuer controls both baseUSD and quoteUSD tokens. They want to run a capital-free spread. They call `placeIssuerFlip(baseUSD, 1_000_000, false, -10, 10, true, true)` to place an issuer ask at tick -10 with a flip tick of +10. No escrow is taken since both issuer flags are true.

When a taker buys 1M baseUSD against this order, the DEX mints 1M baseUSD to the taker and burns the quoteUSD received as payment. The order flips to an issuer bid at tick +10. When a different taker sells baseUSD against this bid, the DEX burns the received baseUSD and mints quoteUSD to pay the seller. The order flips back to an ask at tick -10, and the cycle continues indefinitely with no capital requirements.
